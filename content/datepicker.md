# Date picker (TDatePicker)

The component is ready but the docs are still a work in progress ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

No worries should be ready within these days so come back later or follow me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alfonsobries) so I can keep you updated.

Meanwhile, you can check this full working example:

<datepicker-example></datepicker-example>

Code for the example above: 

```html
<t-datepicker
  v-model="date"
  placeholder="Select a date"
  date-format="Y-m-d"
  user-format="m/d/Y"
/>
```
