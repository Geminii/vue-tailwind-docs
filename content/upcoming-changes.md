# Upcoming changes

Updates and deprecations coming in the future and how to prepare for them.

<hr>

### 1. Time-picker feature for the Datepicker component

I'm working in adding a time picker to the datepicker component, probably that feature will be released as a new optional setting that shouldn't conflict with the current version but there is a possibility that may affect the way the component is used.

### 2. Dialog component

I'm officially working in a new Dialog component inspired in the [Sweetalert library](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) I expect to have it ready during this month depending of the amount of work I have.

### 3. More componets on the way

I want to add a couple of more components and im currently considering a file input/manager, autocomplete, carousel and probably more, still no special priority.

## Plans for version 2.x

I have big plans for the next version of this library that includes:

- New branding (website, logo, name, etc)
- Rebuilt for Vue 3
- Strongly considering make a sibling library for React 
- More Typescript improvements
- No dependencies
- Stronger test coverage
- General improvements 
- Sponsorware premium components that may help me to maintain this project [more about the Sponsorware model â†’](https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware)
